              <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or
                [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese dish of
                prepared vinegared
                rice (鮨飯,
                sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt,
                accompanied by a variety of ingredients (ネタ,
                neta), such as
                seafood, often
                raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice",
                also referred
                to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯). Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can
                be prepared
                with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail,
                salmon, tuna or
                imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi,
                and soy sauce.
                Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.Sushi is sometimes confused with
                sashimi, a related
                dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.Text from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi" target="_blank">this site</a>.</p>

                <p>Sushi is a very healthy meal! It's a good source of heart healthy omega-3 fatty acids thanks to the fish it's made with. Sushi is also low in calories – there's no added fat.The most common type is nigiri sushi – fingers of sticky rice topped with a small filet of fish or seafood. On average, one piece of sushi nigiri has about 70 calories. A typical order of 6 pieces provides 310 to 420 calories, depending on the type of fish.</p>

                  <h4>Salmon </h4>
                  <p> Salmon is the common name for several species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. Other fish in the same family
                    include trout, char, grayling, and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and Pacific
                    Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus). Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of
                    North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.Typically, salmon are
                    anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of
                    several species are restricted to fresh water throughout their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot
                    where they hatched to spawn. Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray
                    and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon. Homing behavior has been
                    shown to depend on olfactory memory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon" target="_blank">this site</a>. </p>

                                <p>The Japanese amberjack or yellowtail, Seriola quinqueradiata, is a species of jack fish in the family Carangidae. It is
                                  native to the northwest Pacific Ocean, from Korea to Hawaii.It is greatly appreciated in Japan, where it is called hamachi or
                                  buri (鰤). These fish are eaten either cooked or raw, and are a seasonal favourite in the colder months when the meat has a
                                  higher fat content. Amberjack is typically thought of as a winter delicacy of Toyama and the Hokuriku region. Although it is
                                  frequently listed on menus as "yellowtail tuna", it is a fish of an entirely different family, the Carangidae, rather than the
                                  family Scombridae that includes tunas, mackerels, and bonitos.Some of the fish consumed are caught wild, but a substantial
                                  amount is farmed (about 120,000 tonnes per year). To populate the pens, every May, workers fish for the small wild fry (called
                                  mojako), which can be found under floating seaweed. They scoop out the seaweed together with the mojako and put the mojako in
                                  cages in the sea. Text from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_amberjack" target="_blank">this site</a>.</p>

                                    maximum reported length is 50 cm (20 in) with a common length of 35 cm (14 in). They have a maximum reported weight of 0.66 kg
                                    (1.5 lb) and a maximum reported age of 12 years.They are found around the coast of Japan, apart from Okinawa Island, usually on
                                    sandy bottoms of 50–275 m (164–902 ft) deep. They feed mainly on small crustaceans such as copepods, and shrimps and small fish.
                                    They are similar to the yellowtail horse mackerel around New Zealand and Australia, apart from having more gill rakers and
                                    larger eyes.[4]Text from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_jack_mackerel"

                                    <p>Sea urchins (/ˈɜːrtʃɪnz/) are typically spiny, globular animals, echinoderms in the class Echinoidea. About
                                      950 species live on the seabed, inhabiting all oceans and depth zones from the intertidal to 5,000 metres
                                      (16,000 ft; 2,700 fathoms).[1] Their hard shells (tests) are round and spiny, usually from 3 to 10 cm (1 to 4
                                      in) across. Sea urchins move slowly, crawling with their tube feet, and sometimes pushing themselves with their
                                      spines. They feed primarily on algae but also eat slow-moving or sessile animals. Their predators include sea
                                      otters, starfish, wolf eels, triggerfish, and humans.Text from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_urchin" target="_blank">this
